Template/Directory structure for database/APEX CICD

#### Pipelines
This directory contains samples of code for Jenkins and Spinnaker for DB/APEX CICD

#### Terraform
Here we have sample code for using terraform in OCI for the following tasks:
 1. **Vanity URL with ADB**: Create a user managed ORDS instance on a compute VM for an autonomous DB and custom domain name using Let's Encrypt
 2. **Vanity URL with DBCS**: Create a user managed ORDS instance on a compute VM for a DBCS instance (VM, BM or ExaCS) and custom domain name using Let's Encrypt
 3. **Simple ORDS setup**: Create a VM with ORDS attached to a DBCS instance
